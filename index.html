			Need a great way to get the kids to eat their veggies?  Let them help with meal prep!!  Plus, add a creamy sauce and flaky topping to all these veggies, and who isn’t going to want to dig right in?!  This pot pie is a great way to add any veggie you like to your dinner and still keep it simple.  It’s a one-dish meal that comes together by using a combo of fresh and frozen veggies, a simple homemade sauce and a flaky pre-made crust.  To me that’s what balance in creating wholesome meals is all about.  Yes, this is really what happens in our house.  The sous chef/recipe critic climbs right up and declares her intent to help me “make recipes!”.  I love it when she helps!  But, I do have to keep an eye on her to make sure she doesn’t add an extra 1/4 cup of salt to anything while I’m working on something else! You are essentially going to want about 6 or 7 cups of veggies plus some onion, garlic and herbs.  You can see above what we used for our pot pie.  Do as much or as little chopping as you want by using more or less frozen or prepared veggies.Get these all loaded up into your slow cooker! You will need one that is at least 4 quarts.  This would be an easy recipe to double by using a 7 quart slow cooker instead.  Use flour, broth, fresh thyme, cornstarch and a little cream to create the perfect homemade sauce.  Once everything has cooked up all day and the veggies are nice and tender we will transfer to a baking dish and top with a puff pastry sheet.  It takes only a few minutes to be golden brown and a delicious homemade pot pie/comfort food dish is done!
